# Data Engineering: Data warehouse tech stack with PostgreSQL, DBT, Airflow
## Objective 
A city traffic department wants to collect traffic data using swarm UAVs (drones) from a number of locations in the city and use the data collected for improving traffic flow in the city and for a number of other tasks. Now the objective is creating a scalable data warehouse that will host the vehicle trajectory data extracted by analyzing footage taken by swarm drones and static roadside cameras.
